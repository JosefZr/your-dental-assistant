so abdo i have made the desing here what u need to do 

so the basic socket io logic that can send messages in a group in private the design is note done yet 

and u dont need to make the crud fonctions for the server and the channel if u dont have to 

and i will be glade if u make them so i can learn from u how to do it it's my first time as u well know 

and the page channels i didn't do them yet i didn't inderstand how it have to work so i just made the pages related to the server so i left it for u to feagure it out 

and thats it if u need anything just tell me and i will help u with the design 

and one more thing u can follow the comments that i left in my code they can help u in the logic if u may use them if u dont its fine just make it work that's it 

and what i have to do next alooone is the auth and the stripe payment and all the functionalities needed to make it work 

and also the profile crud operations  

and the courses logic that i dont have any adea how to do it i dont even know is it big or note

and the functions of the daily tasks for avery user that he can make plane or note ot whetever 



and at the end if u want to see the logic or the design of the joinrealworld platform i can send u the credantials and u can see all what u need and more whether it's about logic and design 


so good luck
